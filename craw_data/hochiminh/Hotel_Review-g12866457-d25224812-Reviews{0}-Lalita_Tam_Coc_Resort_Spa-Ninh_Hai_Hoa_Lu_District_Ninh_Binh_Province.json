Room was beautiful, attention to detail was flawless, and the staff could not have been better. We tried 2 different rooms, both terrific, amazing bath (we are bath connoisseurs :-) ), great views, and attention to details and cleanliness could not be better.  Staff assisted us with taxis to Hanoi, day trips, free bikes, motorbikes, area information, spa access - just memorable. There is a fun paddy field with crazy paths in front of the building - super fun.  I expect this is the best hotel in town - we could not find or see anything else of the calibre (and we do our research). Tam Coc is the place to stay - this is the scenic area tourists seek and there's a lot in bicycle distance (not Ninh Binh - which is just an average", "reviewer_location": "dumpxxx"}, {"name": "Chalmers", "avatar": "", "review_rating": "5", "review_title": "Absolutely love the beauty", "review_content": "The hotel is very clean and in good location.
